### Getting Set up
Any pace that you like

10min ~ 30min

Try carve out every single day as sort of **habit**

Watch entirely and try `vs` See, pause and try and get back to video `vs` Go same time with video 

Figure out which way is best

No need to use any framework (only **plain js**)

Good to do with friend!

Go hit the videos and enjoy day1

### 14. Object and Arrays - Reference VS Copy
**Array**
```js
let age = 100;
let age2 = age;
//100 100
age = 200;
//200 100

let name = 'Wes';
let name2 = name;
//Wes Wes
name = 'Wesley'
//Wesley Wes
```

```js
const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
const team = players;
//['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'] ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']
team[3] = 'Lux';
//['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux'] ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux'] 
```
- `team` is a reference to original array `players`
- if update any of `team`, it will change `players`


- Than how do we fix this? We take a copy instad!**
```js
const team2 = players.slice();
const team3 = [].concat(players);
const team4 = [...players];
const team5 = Array.from(players);
```

**Objects**
```js
const person = {
    name: 'Wes',
    age: 80
}

const captain = person;
captain.number = 99;
//person becomes Object{name: 'Wes', age:80, number: 99}
```

- how do we take a copy instead?  
we take blank obj, fold in all of properties and values from obj, use third args to fold in our own ones
```js
const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});
const cap3 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 12});
```
- Shallow, which means it will only go on one level deep
```js
//React
const cap4 = {...person};
```

```js
const wes = {
    name: 'Wes',
    age: 100,
    social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos'
    }
}

const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
dev.social.twitter = '@coolman';
//dev become same with wes
```
- bcz obj.assign only does one level deep
- if need clone, use `clone deep`
- can use below but mostly deep obj copy is not needed / not recommended
```js
const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
```
